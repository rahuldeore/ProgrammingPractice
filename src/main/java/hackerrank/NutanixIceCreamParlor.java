 *
 * Each time Sunny and Johnny take a trip to the Ice Cream Parlor, they pool their money to buy ice cream. On any given
 * day, the parlor offers a line of flavors. Each flavor has a cost associated with it.
 *
 * Given the value of money and the cost of each flavor for t trips to the Ice Cream Parlor, help Sunny and Johnny choose\
 * two distinct flavors such that they spend their entire pool of money during each visit. ID numbers are the 1- based
 * index number associated with a cost. For each trip to the parlor, print the ID numbers for the two types of ice cream
 * that Sunny and Johnny purchase as two space-separated integers on a new line. You must print the smaller ID first
 * and the larger ID second.
 *
 * For example, there are n=5 flavors having cost=[2,1,3,5,6]. Together they have money=5 to spend. They would purchase
 * flavor ID's 1 and 3 for a cost of 2+3=5. Use 1 based indexing for your response.
 *
 * Note:
 * Two ice creams having unique IDs i and j may have the same cost (i.e., cost[i] = cost[j]).
 * There will always be a unique solution.
